You can integrate your bot with [Kik messenger](https://dev.kik.com) bot platform to enable your Kik bot understand a natural language.

## How to create a Kik bot
There is a [reat guide](https://dev.kik.com/#/docs/getting-started) regarding bot development for Kik.
Just perform all related steps and provide the bot\'s **Username** and obtain an **API Key**.

### Setup Username and API Key
In Zenbot web console go to the "Kik Settings" section and provide previously obtained **Username** and **API Key** of your Kik bot.

Press "Save settings" button, and that is all!
Now your Kik bot can receive text requests and respond regarding your Botscript in Zenbot.

## Variables
Each time Zenbot receives a request from Kik, it generates a set of special variables you can use inside a Botscript.

- **req_kik_chat_id** - an ID of chat from where the request was sent
- **req_kik_user** - a nickname of Kik user
- **req_kik_bot** - Kik bot Username
- **req_kik_key** - Kik bot API Key

## Restrictions
Please note that Kik doesn\'t provide any extended info about the user, like latitude and longitude, current time and GMT offset.
Thus you have to obtain this data on your own if you need it.
