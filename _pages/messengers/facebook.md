Zenbot implements Facebook Messenger\'s API and enables your bots to talk with users over Facebook Messenger.
Moreover - you do not have to have an external hosting for your Facebook\'s chat bot.

{% include note.html text="Nevertheless you can host any of your chat bot related logic on your side and integrate it with Zenbot over REST API." %}

## Bots in Facebook
Strictly speaking a bot in Facebook - is just a Facebook Page connected to Facebook App.
Each time the user sends a message to such a page, connected app receives request and responds with some automated response.

Thus you have to create a page and connect it to Zenbot. And there are two ways to do it - via your own Facebook App or via Zenbot App.

### Connect via Zenbot
**This is the most quick and easy way to publish your bot in Facebook.**

In this case you don\'t need to create a Facebook App, configure it, write descriptions, and finally - you don\'t need to pass through a [Facebook App review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review) process before you bot becomes available for millions.

{% include note.html text="An app review is a complicated process which takes up to 5 business days and requires you to provide a lot of data including descriptions, icons, screen cast, commands list and a set of required API scopes." %}

That is why Zenbot provides it\'s own Facebook App which can be easily used by your Facebook Page to publish your own bot.
All you need to do - is to sign in with your Facebook account in Zenbot\'s web console and select one of your Facebook pages (or [create a new page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/)).

After that you have to click "Connect" button and **that is it!**
You have published your bot in three clicks without any app review and complicated settings.

### Connect via your App
If you would like to use your own Facebook App to connect it to your bot, you have to create an app and provide page access token and verification token in Zenbot\'s web console.
_See details below_.

{% include note.html text="Please note that in this case you have to pass through an app review process in Facebook" %}

## How to create a Facebook chat bot
There is a [complete guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) on how to create chat bot for Facebook Messenger platform.

Thus you have to create Facebook app and Facebook page or use existing one.

### Webhook
When setting up a webhook, provide a URL like `https://zenbot.org/api/facebook/<id of your Zenbot bot here>`.

_You can see this URL in Zenbot web console._

Zenbot already implements everything your bot needs to validate a webhook and catch up messages from users.

{% include note.html text="Note that before setting up a webhook you have to select any Verify Token and provide it inside your bot settings.
Only if this setting is saved you can verify and save webhook in the Facebook's app settings console." %}

### Subscription Fields
You have to check "messages", "messaging_optins" and "messaging_postbacks" to make your bot receive messages from Facebook Messenger.

### Page Access Token
Generate your page Access Token and provide it inside your bot\'s settings.

Zenbot will subscribe your app to the page automatically and will be ready to catch text requests from users over your Facebook app.

## Get Started Button
You can enable "Get Started Button" in the bot\'s preferences to allow user to start your bot by pressing a special button the first time. 
This enables your bot to process some initial dialog with the user.

Each time the user clicks this button your bot will receive some text input and can generate any response as for regular input. 
The default text command is **/start** but you can change it on the configuration page in Zenbot\'s web console.
Thus you have to define `/start` (or any other) input pattern in your Botscript to handle this and generate some output. 

{% include note.html text="Note that you have to enable Get Started Button in the Zenbot'\s web console" %}

[Read more](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/get-started-button) about Get Started button in the Facebook Messenger documentation.

## Send to Messenger button
Each time the user presses "Send to Messenger" button of your bot on any website, your bot receives a **/start** message following by some _optional payload_.

Thus you have to define `/start $Text` input pattern in your Botscript if your bot has to send some response to the user if she clicks "Send to Messenger" button.
In this case `$Text` variable will contain _optional payload_ passed by "Send to Messenger" button\'s "ref" param.

Please read more on [Send-to-Messenger Plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/plugin-reference/send-to-messenger) page.

## Persistent Menu
Your bot can provide a persistent menu which contains a set of useful text commands or links to external websites.
This menu is always available to the user in the bottom left corner of Messenger\'s client.
Once the user taps on one of the menu items, Messenger sends a text command to your bot or opens an URL of website.

You can easily build such menu in Zenbot\'s web console. Just provide the Label and Payload of each menu item and click "Save menu" button.
Note that you can drag and drop items to re-order them.

IF the Payload of a menu item contains a text command, it will be sent to your bot once the user clicks on this menu item.
Thus you have to define a corresponding input pattern in your Botscript to handle this text command.

## Test your Facebook bot
Just open your app\'s Facebook page, click on "Messages" and send some messages.
Your Zenbot\'s bot will reply with text regarding your [Botscript](/botscript/).

## Quick replies
Using a [sample](/botscript/sample/) tag you can generate [Quick replies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/quick-replies) buttons.

Once the user clicks on one of them, your bot receives a request with text corresponding the clicked button.

## Native output

If you wish your bot to generate some complex Facebook Messenger related output (like images, generic templates, buttons and etc) you can define a complete [Messenger API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference) related JSON in the [output](/botscript/output/) tag.

```xml
<output>
    <!CDATA[
        "attachment":{
          "type":"template",
          "payload":{
            "template_type":"generic",
            "elements":[
              {
                "title":"Welcome to Peter\'s Hats",
                "item_url":"https://petersfancybrownhats.com",
                "image_url":"https://petersfancybrownhats.com/company_image.png",
                "subtitle":"We\'ve got the right hat for everyone.",
                "buttons":[
                  {
                    "type":"web_url",
                    "url":"https://petersfancybrownhats.com",
                    "title":"View Website"
                  },
                  {
                    "type":"postback",
                    "title":"Start Chatting",
                    "payload":"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD"
                  }              
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
    ]]>
</output>
```

If the user clicks on one of the buttons with postback, this postback will be received by Zenbot as an input.

_Note that you have to define only a "message" part of the JSON message._

## Variables
Each time Zenbot receives a request from Facebook Messenger, it generates a set of special variables you can use inside a Botscript.

- **req_facebook_token** - a page token of the bot
- **req_facebook_user_firstname** - user\'s first name
- **req_facebook_user_lastname** - user\'s last name
- **req_facebook_user_gender** - user\'s gender
