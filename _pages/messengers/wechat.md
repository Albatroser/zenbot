## How to create a WeChat bot

To create a WeChat bot you have to fill a [Sign up form](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?t=register/step1_tmpl) to obtain an official WeChat account.

### Basic API
Once your account has been approved (it may take some time), please go to the "Developers section" in the WeChat console and provide **URL** and any **Token** for your bot.

Please use a URL like `https://zenbot.org/api/wechat/<id of your Zenbot here>` as a URL for incoming requests in your WeChat bot console.

_You can see this URL in "WeChat Settings" section in Zenbot web console._

### WeChat bot Token

## Test your WeChat bot
Now you can send some text requests though a WeChat client to your bot and receive responses from Zenbot regarding a Botscript.

{% include note.html text="Note that there may be a delay between a request and response because Zenbot severs are placed outside China." %}

## Variables
Each time Zenbot receives a request from WeChat, it generates a set of special variables you can use inside a Botscript.

- **req_wechat_user** - an ID of WeChat user who has sent a request
- **req_wechat_to** - an ID of WeChat bot

## Restrictions
Please note that WeChat doesn\'t provide any extended info about the user, like latitude and longitude, current time and GMT offset.
Thus you have to obtain this data on your own if you need it.
