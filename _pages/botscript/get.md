This tag describes a HTTP GET request action and a variable name for response.

This tag may contain:

- a set of HTTP params
- a set of HTTP headers

## Summary
Zenbot is more than a pattern matcher.
It enables you to perform a common actions to implement natural language interface.
HTTP request is one of such actions.

You can request any HTTP service to fetch some data and store it into named variable.

```xml
<input pattern="* (weather|forecast)">
  <get url="http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather" var="Weather">
    <param name="APPID" value="API_KEY"/>
    <param name="units" value="metric"/>
    <param name="lat" value="$UserLatitude"/>
    <param name="lon" value="$UserLongitude"/>
  </get>

  <output value='get("temp", get("main", $Weather))'/>
</input>
```

The example above shows the usage of this tag.
You have to provide a _url_ and _var_ attributes to make a request and store a response.
And also provide optional set of HTTP parameters and headers.

Zenbot will perform a request and store it\'s result into variable with name defined in the _var_ attribute.

{% include note.html text="Note that this variable will have an input scope." %}

Further you can perform some stuff with this variable while it is a [regular variable](/botscript/var/).

## JSON response
Zenbot knows that often we will have deal with a REST APIs of different external services.
So it will look in the response before storing it and try to parse it.

Thus a JSON formatted response will be automatically converted to the object or array.
And you can perform some operations with it as with a regular object or array.

The example above shows how you can extract particular fields righ inside an [output](/botscript/output/) tag using [expressions](/expressions/).
It uses a _get_ function to extract the "temp" field from JSON object, which is a result of extracting the "main" field from HTTP response.
Well, such chained usage of the single function enables you to obtain any data from JSON response.

You could also use a Javascript expression to make the same stuff in common way:

```xml
<var name="Temp" value="javascript: Weather.main.temp"/>
<output value="$Temp"/>
```

But this solution requires to create an external variable.

{% include note.html text="Note that you should not use $ symbol before variable name when you use Javascript expressions." %}

## XML response
If an endpoint returns XML-formatted response (like RSS for example), Zenbot will parse it automatically and create an object with fields corresponding to the structure of XML.
Thus you don\'t need to parse it on your own as in case with JSON response.

## Raw response
Of course you can make requests to the external services which respond with non JSON or XML responses.
In such case Zenbot will store a _raw body of response_ in the defined variable.

There are a set of useful functions to work with such responses, like CSS selector and HTML attributes extractor.
Read more about these functions in the [special chapter](/expressions/).

## Timeouts
Zenbot wouldn\'t wait too much. So it uses HTTP response timeout about 15 seconds.

## Parameters and headers
You can define a set of HTTP request\'s parameters and headers inside the get tag.

### **param** tag
Use this inner tag to define a request parameter.

It should contain a _name_ and _value_ attributes.

### **header** tag
Define a set of optional headers inside a _get_ tag if you need.

Each _header_ tag should contain a _name_ and _value_ attributes.

## Attributes

### **url** attribute
Define the URL of the external service in this required attribute.

**Do not provide the parameters set inside it.** Please use an inner _param_ tags for this purpose.

### **var** attribute
Define a name of [variable](/botscript/var/) to save the response in for this request. It is required attribute.

### **if** attribute
You can define a condition (using [expressions](/vars/expressions/)) which will be performed to check if Zenbot should execute a request.
If such condition is defined, Zenbot will previously evaluate it and if it returns 1 Zenbot will perform request.
Otherwise this request will be skipped.

### **lang** attribute
Define user\'s request language code if this action should be performed only for the particular language.

### **channel** attribute
Define channel IDs here to make an HTTP call only for requests from the particular messengers.
