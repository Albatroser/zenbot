## Summary
Zenbot also enables you to use general Javascript code instead of [simple expressions](/vars/expressions/) to calculate any variable\'s value.
Thus you are not limited with expressions syntax and built-in functions and can use your own code on well known Javascript programming language for this purpose.

## Little snippet

```xml
<input pattern="repeat($Number)">
  <var name="Numbers">
    <script>
      <![CDATA[
        var result = '';
        for (var i = 0; i < $Number.lenght; i++) {
          result += $Number[i] + ' ';
        }
        result;
      ]]>
    </script>
  </var>
  <output value="There are your numbers $Numbers"/>
</input>
```

This simple code shows how you can use Javascript code to calculate a "Numbers" variable value.

There is a special inner tag _script_ you have to insert inside the _var_ tag.
Note that you have to use CDATA to prevent XML parser from processing the inner Javascript code.

{% include note.html text="Note that you must not use \"return\" keyword in your Javascript." %}

## Inline mode
You can also define your Javascript code in more compact mode:

```xml
<var name="MyVar" value="javascript: new Date().getTime()"/>
```

Just place "javascript:" keyword in the _value_ attribute of your _var_ tag before the Javascript code.
Thus Zenbot will evaluate such code to obtain an actual variable\'s value.

## Referencing external variables
In the code above you can see how you can reference some external variables inside your Javascript code.
Zenbot converts each variable from patterns for you, so you can work with them as with a regular object and arrays in Javascript.

## Limitations
Javascript code in Zenbot runs inside a safe "sandbox".
Thus you cannot use any sort of network functions or file system\'s abstractions.
